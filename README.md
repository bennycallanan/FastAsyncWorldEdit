# FastAsyncWorldEdit | Folia

This fork aims to implement the entirety of the FastAsyncWorldEdit against Folia
(and forks) and even reintroduces commands like `//regen`. That said, not everything
will be nor is perfect. If you encounter an issue specific to my fork, feel free to
create an issue report. Some mechanical issues relating to NBT data retention may in
fact persist and this is caused by upstream, which means I am likely not to resolve/fix
said issues.
